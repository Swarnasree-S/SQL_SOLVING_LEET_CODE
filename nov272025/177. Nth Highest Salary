DIFF between LIMIT AND OFFSET
-----------------------------------

// *In MySQL, OFFSET is used in a LIMIT clause to skip a number of rows before returning the results.

Syntax:

SELECT column_name
FROM table_name
ORDER BY some_column
LIMIT row_count OFFSET skip_count;


row_count → how many rows you want to return.

OFFSET skip_count → how many rows to skip first.*//
