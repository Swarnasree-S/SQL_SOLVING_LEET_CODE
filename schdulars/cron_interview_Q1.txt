✅ Perfect Answer (Question 1)
Cron Question 1

👉 What is cron and why do we use it in Linux?

“Cron is a time-based scheduler in Linux used to automate tasks.
We use cron to run scripts or commands automatically at specific times—like every minute, hour, day, month, or week—based on the cron time fields.”

“The cron expression */5 * * * * means this job runs every 5 minutes.
The command uses /usr/bin/curl to call a PHP script on the server.
Output is saved into /var/log/renewgrid/inacpower.log.
The >> appends logs, and 2>&1 merges error logs with normal output.”

=======================================================
User Cron vs System Cron
Feature	User Cron	System Cron
Definition	Cron jobs scheduled by individual users	Cron jobs scheduled at the system level
Crontab Location	/var/spool/cron/crontabs/username	/etc/crontab and /etc/cron.* directories (cron.daily, cron.hourly, etc.)
Privileges	Runs with the user’s permissions	Runs with system/root privileges
Editing Command	crontab -e (as that user)	Edit /etc/crontab or files in /etc/cron.d/
Use Case	Personal scripts, small tasks for that user	System maintenance, backups, package updates, monitoring tasks

💡 Tip for interview:

User cron is for individual users to schedule their own tasks; system cron is for administrative/system-level tasks that may affect multiple users or the whole system.
