✅ Top 20 Python Interview Questions (with answers)
1. What is Python?

Python is a high-level, interpreted, object-oriented programming language used for automation, web apps, data science, ML, etc.

2. What are Python’s key features?

Easy to read

Interpreted (Interpreted means → The code is not compiled into machine code beforehand.
Instead, the Python interpreter reads and executes the code line-by-line.

Simple Explanation

Compiled language (C, C++, Java):
Code → Compiler → Machine code → Runs

Interpreted language (Python, JavaScript):
Code → Interpreter executes line by line → Runs

What it really means:

✔ No need to compile
✔ Easy to test and run immediately
✔ Slower than compiled languages because it executes line-by-line
✔ More flexible (dynamic typing, easy debugging) One-line answer for interview:

"Interpreted means the code is executed line-by-line by an interpreter instead of being compiled into machine code beforehand.")

Dynamically typed

Object-oriented

Huge standard library

Cross-platform(ChatGPT said:

Cross-platform means a software, program, or language that can run on multiple operating systems without needing big changes.

✔ Simple Meaning

If something is cross-platform, it works on:

Windows

Linux

macOS
(or even mobile platforms like Android/iOS)

✔ Example

Python is cross-platform →
The same Python code can run on Windows, Linux, and Mac with very small or no changes.

Example code:

print("Hello World")


This runs on all OS without modification.

✔ Real-life Examples
Software	Cross-platform?	Runs On
Python	✔ Yes	Windows, Linux, Mac
Java	✔ Yes	Windows, Linux, Mac
Google Chrome	✔ Yes	Windows, Linux, Mac, Android, iOS
Notepad.exe	✖ No	Only Windows
✔ Why is cross-platform important (Interview answer)

Portability – code runs everywhere

Cost saving – no need to rewrite for every OS

More users – supports many environments

Easy maintenance – one codebase

✔ Short Interview Answer

"Cross-platform means the ability of software to run on multiple operating systems like Windows, Linux, and macOS without modifications.")

3. What is PEP 8?

PEP 8 is the style guide for writing clean Python code (naming, spacing, indentation rules).

4. What is the difference between list and tuple?
List	Tuple
Mutable	Immutable
[]	()
Slower	Faster

(ChatGPT said:

Mutable meaning (in simple words):

Mutable = changeable.
A mutable object means you can change its value after creation.

✅ Examples in Python:

Mutable objects:

list

dict

set

You can modify them:

a = [1, 2, 3]
a[0] = 10   # changed


Immutable objects (not changeable):

int

float

str

tuple

You cannot modify them:

x = "hello"
x[0] = 'H'   # ❌ Error — strings are immutable

👍 One-line meaning:

Mutable = can be modified.
Immutable = cannot be modified.)
5. What is a dictionary in Python?

A dictionary stores data in key–value pairs.
Example: {"name": "John", "age": 25}.

6. What is slicing?

Extracting a portion of a list/string.
Example:

s = "swarna"
print(s[1:4])  # war

**7. What are *args and kwargs?

*args → variable number of positional arguments

**kwargs → variable number of keyword arguments
(*args → list/tuple of values

**kwargs → dictionary of key-value pairs

✅ Both together

Your example:

def fun(*args, **kwargs):
    print(args, kwargs)


Calling it:

fun(10, 20, name="John", age=25)


Output:

(10, 20) {'name': 'John', 'age': 25}

✔ Breakdown:

10, 20 → go into args (tuple of positional arguments)

name="John", age=25" → go into kwargs (dictionary of keyword arguments))

Example:

def fun(*args, **kwargs):
    print(args, kwargs)

8. What is a lambda function?

A small anonymous function.

x = lambda a: a * 2(A lambda function in Python is a small, anonymous (no name) function defined using the keyword lambda.

✅ Definition

A lambda function is a one-line function used for short, simple operations.

✅ Syntax
lambda arguments: expression

📌 Example 1 — Simple addition
add = lambda a, b: a + b
print(add(3, 5))


Output:

8

📌 Example 2 — Square of a number
square = lambda x: x * x
print(square(4))


Output:

16)

9. What is the difference between append() and extend()?

append() → adds one element

extend() → adds elements of an iterable
(Difference Between append() and extend() in Python
Feature	append()	extend()
Purpose	Adds one item to the end of the list	Adds multiple items to the list
Input Type	Takes a single element (object)	Takes an iterable (list, tuple, string, etc.)
How it behaves	Adds the item as it is	Iterates over the items and adds each element
Modifies list?	Yes	Yes
Example 1: append()
a = [1, 2, 3]
a.append([4, 5])
print(a)


Output:

[1, 2, 3, [4, 5]]


👉 The entire list [4,5] is added as one element.

Example 2: extend()
a = [1, 2, 3]
a.extend([4, 5])
print(a)


Output:

[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]


👉 extend() unpacks the list and adds each element.

In Simple Words

append() → adds whole object as a single item

extend() → adds each element of the object individually)

10. What is OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)?

A programming style using classes and objects.
Main concepts: Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction

11. What is init()?

The constructor of a Python class.
Executed automatically when creating an object.

12. What is a module?

A file containing Python code (.py).
Example: import math.

13. What is a package?

A folder containing many Python modules and an __init__.py file.

14. What are decorators?

A function that modifies another function's behavior.

@decorator
def fun():
    pass

15. What is list comprehension?

A short way to create lists:

squares = [x*x for x in range(5)]

16. What is a generator?

A function that returns data using yield.
Used for memory-efficient iteration.

17. What is exception handling?

Handling runtime errors using:

try:
    ...
except:
    ...
finally:
    ...

18. What is the difference between =, ==, and === ?

= assignment

== value equality

=== does not exist in Python

19. How to open and read a file in Python?
with open("file.txt", "r") as f:
    data = f.read()

20. What is the GIL (Global Interpreter Lock)?

GIL allows only one thread to execute Python bytecode at a time.
Affects multi-threaded CPU tasks.


("In compiled languages, the entire code is converted into machine code first, and then we run it.
In interpreted languages, the code is run line-by-line by the interpreter without a separate compilation step."

Want the exact one-line interview answer?

"Compiler → converts whole program to machine code before execution.
Interpreter → executes code directly line-by-line without pre-compilation.")
