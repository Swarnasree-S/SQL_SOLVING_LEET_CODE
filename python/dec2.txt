Cross-platform(ChatGPT said:

Cross-platform means a software, program, or language that can run on multiple operating systems without needing big changes.

✔ Simple Meaning

If something is cross-platform, it works on:

Windows

Linux

macOS
(or even mobile platforms like Android/iOS)

✔ Example

Python is cross-platform →
The same Python code can run on Windows, Linux, and Mac with very small or no changes.

Example code:

print("Hello World")


This runs on all OS without modification.

✔ Real-life Examples
Software	Cross-platform?	Runs On
Python	✔ Yes	Windows, Linux, Mac
Java	✔ Yes	Windows, Linux, Mac
Google Chrome	✔ Yes	Windows, Linux, Mac, Android, iOS
Notepad.exe	✖ No	Only Windows
✔ Why is cross-platform important (Interview answer)

Portability – code runs everywhere

Cost saving – no need to rewrite for every OS

More users – supports many environments

Easy maintenance – one codebase

✔ Short Interview Answer

"Cross-platform means the ability of software to run on multiple operating systems like Windows, Linux, and macOS without modifications.")

Executed automatically when creating an object.

12. What is a module?

A file containing Python code (.py).
Example: import math.

13. What is a package?

A folder containing many Python modules and an __init__.py file.

14. What are decorators?

A function that modifies another function's behavior.

@decorator
def fun():
    pass

15. What is list comprehension?

A short way to create lists:

squares = [x*x for x in range(5)]

16. What is a generator?

A function that returns data using yield.
Used for memory-efficient iteration.

17. What is exception handling?

Handling runtime errors using:

try:
    ...
except:
    ...
finally:
    ...

18. What is the difference between =, ==, and === ?
